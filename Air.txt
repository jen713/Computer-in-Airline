In the airport there are many flights landing and taking off. Unlike road traffic, the flights donâ€™t have direct information of other flights around them. The Air Traffic Control (ATC) at the ground gives instructions to each flight on what it should do.
Similarly, instructions are provided to computer to accomplish specific tasks. Such instructions are known as program and the act of creating a program is known as **programming**.
